Warehouse Management system plays an important role in the modern  world of technologies.Information technology enhance the performance and the efficiency of warehouse management to manage and handle inventories.Warehouse generally refers to a dozen or even dozens of shelves used to carry on goods storage,with the corresponding material goods storage,with the corresponding material handling equipment for cargo inbound and outbound warehouse operations.It is vividly called "warehouse" just for the reason that this kind of warehouse could make full use of space to store goods.Through this minor project we have designed a warehouse managerial analysis system with prediction that is a web-based system useful for warehouse managers to store and maintain the details of their stock purchase and sales. It also does other management activities such as - It stores details of stock purchase like number of items purchased,category of ordered product, details of customers price of each product and so on.The provisions to sell the product ordered by the customers,to save the details of the remaining stocks are given to Admin only . The website provides an elaborate analysis on the stocks available,Ordered product and delivered products and detailed reports are generated. The method proposed by us can help procurement staff save time, and it can also reduce the influence of the shortage of goods for sales.Order records of past years are used to predict the future sales of the company(Month wise).
